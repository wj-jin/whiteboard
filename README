A small collaborative drawing app.
Just experimenting.

checkout with: 

git clone git@github.com:pascalopitz/whiteboard.git --recursive

Try is by going into the directory, and type:

node app.js

There will be a web server on port 9000 and a websocket thingy on 9001.

Want to add redis support to serialize a canvas.
Also want postit notes to be pushed on top.

Pinched the basic drawing bit from http://www.damonkohler.com/2008/12/javascript-painting-with-canvas.html
